## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
Auralis may trigger a **false positive virus flag** in some antivirus software.  
This is a common occurrence with custom-built executables and does **not** indicate malicious behavior.  
You can verify the authenticity of your download using the SHA256 hash provided with each release.

## üîí Verification Instructions

Each release includes a `.sha256` file containing the SHA256 hash of the build.  
To verify your download:

- **Windows PowerShell**  
  ```powershell
  Get-FileHash .\Auralis.exe -Algorithm SHA256
  ```
- **Linux / macOS**  
  ```bash
  sha256sum Auralis.exe
  ```

Compare the result with the contents of `Auralis.exe.sha256`.  
If they match exactly, your file is authentic.
